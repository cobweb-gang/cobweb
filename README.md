# Cobweb

Cobweb is an application for sharing internet access with peers. It uses D2D mesh networking techniques to achieve this.

Currently, we are in the MVP-building phase, so we are focused on building a a minimal and simple implementation of the concept. The finished MVP will be able to do these three things:

- Establish connections between other Cobweb nodes
- Proxy requests through chains of multiple nodes
- Basic validation between nodes
